Offered by the School of Mathematics and Computer Science (SMCS), the MS in Data Science (MSDS) program prepares students to extract valuable insights from data through a unique and comprehensive methodology. The program is designed for students who want to begin or advance their careers in the field of data science. It provides a powerful base in subjects including statistical modeling, probabilistic  reasoning,  machine  learning,  management  of  massive  data  sets,  data  visualization,  and software  engineering.  The  program  targets  both  CS  and  STEM  (Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and Mathematics)  students  and  prepares  them  to  apply  the  knowledge  of  data  science  to  a  wide  range  of corporate  domains.  Non-CS/SE/IT  students  are  required  to  take  non-credit  foundation-level  courses  in algorithms, data management and application development. These courses prepare them for the core and more advanced data science courses alongside students with a CS, IT or SE background. The MSDS core courses strengthen the students' understanding of mathematical concepts that form the basis of machine learning and statistical modeling along with both theoretical and hands-on skills in big data management and analytics. Students can opt from a range of electives including, but not limited to deep learning, text analytics, computer vision, business intelligence, time series analysis, information retrieval and social network analysis. The potential of this program in terms of imparting useful and advanced data science skills and professional  growth  is  measured  by  the  readiness  of  the  job  market  and  advanced  learning  schools  in absorbing graduates. The curriculum design ensures that the graduates can creatively find technology-based solutions,  think  critically  and  analyze  systems  and  emerging  problems  independently. Hence, the vision of MSDS is to train students to create an impact of data science in the local and international industries.\", 'title': 'Institute of Business Administration Program Annoucments', 'filename': 'pa.pdf', 'heading': 'Master of Science (MS) Data Science', 'page_num': 97}, {'id': 356, 'text': 'For the eligibility criteria, refer to pages 83-85.', 'title': 'Institute of Business Administration Program Annoucments', 'filename': 'pa.pdf', 'heading': 'Eligibility criteria.', 'page_num': 97}, {'id': 357, 'text': 'For the non-CS/IT/SE students who take the foundation-level courses, the total minimum duration is 2.5 years (with a total of 5 semesters).
