The IBA hostels provide an atmosphere where students can learn and develop life-long associations while enjoying a comfortable setting.
Residents' security is a top priority for the institute and the hostels are  guarded 24/7 by professional security personnel, with the entrance and exit points under constant CCTV surveillance.

Welcome to the School of Economics and Social Sciences (SESS), where faculty and students engage in holistic, interdisciplinary scholarship in the social sciences to solve complex, real-world problems and improve quality of life in society. SESS houses two scholastic divisions devoted to this mission - Social Sciences & Liberal Arts (SSLA) and Economics.
SSLA is designed to cover a range of disciplines in the Social Sciences and Humanities, comprising of courses in the fields of Social and Cultural Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology, Urban Studies, Media and Culture, English Writing and Rhetoric History among several others. The recently introduced MS Development Studies program has an interdisciplinary approach that enables scholars and practitioners of Development to consider the specificity of societies in terms of history, ecology, culture, technology, politics, etc., and how these differences translate into varied 'local' responses to regional or global significance. MS Journalism is another unique graduate program which allows students to immerse themselves in all forms of journalism - digital, audio and video- and gain practical experience in a newsroom under the guidance of experienced journalists and instructors.
In the department of Economics, we are committed to excellence in research through undergraduate programs of BS Economics and BS Economics and Mathematics. The students learn theory, empirical investigation and policy analysis. We also have PhD and MS Economics programs where students regularly present their on-going research and write on local economic issues.
As the Dean of SESS, I welcome you to this great learning environment and assure you quality learning under the supervision of faculty members of international caliber.

The foremost aim of SMCS will be to establish academic linkages with leading science schools of the world so that we can enhance our teaching and research. This would assist innovations
through joint research projects, focused on bringing new knowledge to the classrooms, thereby enriching academic transactions at IBA. The second aim is to offer more streams of specializations. We have introduced an MS program in Data Science and also plan to offer more programs in Mathematics and Computer Science. This will help diversify our portfolio to attract brilliant students, as well as high-caliber researchers and faculty. We envisage more productive and society-driven research in the new school. A new BS program in Mathematics is also a step in this direction.
With the IBA's mission to undertake consultancy and applied research to enrich teaching and influence thinking on important issues of business and public policy, we believe that SMCS will play a pivotal role in bringing a significant contribution to the global challenges that science and technology can solve.",Institute of Business Administration Program Annoucments,pa.pdf,Dean's Message,82

I am greatly honored to share the Dean's message with my faculty members who have contributed with their hard work, vision, and leadership, to make this school one of the best science schools in the country.
The history of science programs in IBA dates to 1983 when it started offering a diploma program in Computer Science to overcome the shortage of information and system analysts in the country. Since then, the venture has matured and now offers BS, MS, and PhD programs in Mathematics and Computer Science. We have established research labs for Artificial Intelligence, Web Science, Big Data, and Telecommunication, supporting the MS and PhD programs in the diverse domains of Computer Science. Likewise, the MS and PhD programs in Mathematics aim to provide a thorough background in theory, quantitative methods, and applications commensurate with international standards, offering the opportunity of highly specialized training in selected areas of pure and applied mathematics.
As IBA moves into the new system of schools, the newly established SMCS must continue to incubate and stay poised toward cutting-edge research and development in science and technology. In the coming years, we plan to enhance our academic programs by investing in our star faculty, establishing strong research and industrial ties across the globe, and bringing new specializations in Mathematics, Computer Science and allied fields. Our mission is to impart quality education to students selected purely on merit, irrespective of ethnicity, gender, religion or financial means.",Institute of Business Administration Program Annoucments,pa.pdf,Department of Mathematical Sciences,82

In  MS  without  Thesis,  the  student  needs  to complete  24  credit  hours  to  register  for  the  MS  Project,  which  is  a  one  semester,  3  credit  hour implementation of a solution to solve an industrial problem related to any domain of computer science.
In  the  MS  Thesis,  the  student  is  required  to  discover  an  innovative  algorithm,  methodology,  framework, entity, or an application, which is clearly distinguishable from the state-of-the-art research. Then, the student implements this innovation and attempts to demonstrate that it works or performs better or at least at par with current research trends. Finally, the student will attempt to publish these findings in a conference, workshop, symposium or  journal  paper.  In the MS Project, the student implements a small-scale product, software, API, solution or similar entity to preferably address  a current industrial need or requirement. The MS Project can also implement an innovative and unique idea of the student or supervisor which might become useful for the industry later.

355,"The field of data science lies at the intersection of machine learning, probability, statistics, linear algebra and big data analytics. Offered by the School of Mathematics and Computer Science (SMCS), the MS in Data Science (MSDS) program prepares students to extract valuable insights from data through a unique and comprehensive methodology. The program is designed for students who want to begin or advance their careers in the field of data science. It provides a powerful base in subjects including statistical modeling, probabilistic  reasoning,  machine  learning,  management  of  massive  data  sets,  data  visualization,  and software  engineering.  The  program  targets  both  CS  and  STEM  (Science,  Technology,  Engineering  and Mathematics)  students  and  prepares  them  to  apply  the  knowledge  of  data  science  to  a  wide  range  of corporate  domains.  Non-CS/SE/IT  students  are  required  to  take  non-credit  foundation-level  courses  in algorithms, data management and application development. These courses prepare them for the core and more advanced data science courses alongside students with a CS, IT or SE background. The MSDS core courses strengthen the students' understanding of mathematical concepts that form the basis of machine learning and statistical modeling along with both theoretical and hands-on skills in big data management and analytics. Students can opt from a range of electives including, but not limited to deep learning, text analytics, computer vision, business intelligence, time series analysis, information retrieval and social network analysis. The potential of this program in terms of imparting useful and advanced data science skills and professional  growth  is  measured  by  the  readiness  of  the  job  market  and  advanced  learning  schools  in absorbing graduates. The curriculum design ensures that the graduates can creatively find technology-based solutions,  think  critically  and  analyze  systems  and  emerging  problems  independently. Hence, the vision of MSDS is to train students to create an impact of data science in the local and international industries.",Institute of Business Administration Program Annoucments,pa.pdf,Master of Science (MS) Data Science,97

In MS with Thesis, the student needs to complete 18 credit hours to take MS Thesis I (research work) and MS Thesis II (thesis work) of 3 credit hours each over two semesters. In MS without Thesis, the student needs to complete 24 credit hours  to  implement  the  MS  Project,  a  one  semester,  3  credit  hour implementation of an industrial solution to solve a data science problem.
In  the  MS  Thesis,  the  student  is  required  to  discover  an  innovative  algorithm,  methodology,  framework, entity, or an application, which is clearly distinguishable from the state-of-the-art research. Then, the student implements this innovation and attempts to demonstrate that it works or performs better or at least at par with current research trends. Finally, the student will attempt to publish these findings in a conference, workshop, symposium or journal paper.  In the MS Project, the  student  implements  a small-scale product, software, API, solution or similar entity to preferably address some current industrial need or requirement. The MS Project can also implement some innovative and unique ideas of the student or supervisor which might become useful for the industry later.
